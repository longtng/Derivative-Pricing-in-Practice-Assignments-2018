# Derivative-Pricing-in-Practice-Assignments-2018
This repository included all of The Derivative Pricing in Practice subject's Assignments. Those assignments are about the applications of various models from theoretical models for underlying (Black-Scholes-Merton, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein...), interest-rate modeling (short-term rate model) to practical methods such as analytical formula, PDE, tree-based, and simulation-based.

All the codes are written in Python.
